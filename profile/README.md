### Useful Resources.

If you want resources about Zcash you can visit the official website: [z.cash](https://z.cash), but I 
strongly recommend that you don't miss [ZECHUB](https://zechub.wiki), the first Zcash DAO ever, dedicated to
curate and produce the best Zcash educational, technical and non-technical resources about Zcash.
